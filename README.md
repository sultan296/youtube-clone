# youtube-clone

In this project, I successfully created a website inspired by YouTube using HTML and CSS. The design closely resembles the original YouTube layout, which I meticulously crafted based on a Figma mockup. The website features a dynamic search bar, user-friendly interface, and interactive elements like icons and buttons, which enhance the overall user experience.
